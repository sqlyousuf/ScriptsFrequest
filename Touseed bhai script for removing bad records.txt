--This script was created by Tausif bhai to find duplicates in 3 columns which are ssn, indiv_created and i_id

--we wanted the i_id of the records which are duplicates in ssn and are the least dates 

--select * from 
-- ##temp
select ssn,count(*) from ##temp group by ssn


select 'Good records list' col1
select * from ##temp A
inner join (select ssn, min(indiv_created) as mindate from ##temp group by ssn) B
on A.indiv_created =B.mindate
and
A.ssn = B.ssn;

select 'bad records list' col2

--select ssn , min(indiv_created) ic into ##T2 from ##temp group by ssn
select * from ##temp A
left join ##T2 B
