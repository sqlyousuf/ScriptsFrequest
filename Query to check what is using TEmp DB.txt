/*
Lists the TempDB usage per each active session.
It helps identifying the sessions that use the tempdb heavily with internal objects.

When the internal objects usage is high, the session is probably using big hash tables or spooling in worktables. It could be a symptom of an inefficient plan or a missing index.

Shrinking a TempDB full of internal objects will probably have no effect, because the engine will not release the deallocated space.
